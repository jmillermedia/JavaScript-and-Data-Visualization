## Thesis:
### Winter Olympic Data 1924-2014
My intention with this data is to show that there is a disparity between the amount of competitions between men and women. While the gap has been closing over the last century, there is still room for improvement for complete equality. Iâ€™ve decided to use the medal count as opposed to the actual events on the chance that some of the events may have been added or removed over the course of this portion of time of the Olympics. This goes under the understanding that every year each event has an outcome where 3 medals are awarded. Thus, the total medals awarded in the timeframe more accurately represents the difference of competitions of both men and women year over year.

In this project, we will be looking at line graphs, bar charts, and pie charts to see how over time, the disparity is closing, but still not at an even 50/50 split.
